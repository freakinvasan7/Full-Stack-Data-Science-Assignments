    "When you assign a list to a variable, you are storing the reference to the list in that variable. This reference points to the actual location in memory where the list is stored. It means that if you assign the same list to multiple variables, they all reference the same underlying list object."

    "If the original object contains references to other objects, the shallow copy will share references to the same nested objects as the original.\n",

    "The copy.deepcopy() function creates a deep copy of the object. It recursively copies the entire object along with all nested objects, ensuring that the copy is fully independent of the original.\n",
